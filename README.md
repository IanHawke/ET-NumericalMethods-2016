To use, install [Anaconda Python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) (version 3, by preference), then

```
conda create -n etschool python=3 ipython jupyter numpy matplotlib scipy notebook sympy
source activate etschool
jupyter notebook
```

Then open the notebooks in the `notebook` directory, which will be used for live coding. Brief solutions are in the `solutions` directory.

It may also be useful to [install ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
